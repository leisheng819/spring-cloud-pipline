= Spring Cloud Pipelines

_Documentation Authors: Marcin Grzejszczak_

Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are tools that allow developers speed up the
time of creating new business features. It's common knowledge however that the
 feature is only valuable if it's in production. That's why companies
 spend a lot of time and resources on building their own deployment pipelines.

This project tries to solve the following problems:

- Creation of a common deployment pipeline
- Propagation of good testing & deployment practices
- Speed up the time required to deploy a feature to production

A common way of running, configuring and deploying applications lowers support costs
and time needed by new developers to blend in when they change projects.
