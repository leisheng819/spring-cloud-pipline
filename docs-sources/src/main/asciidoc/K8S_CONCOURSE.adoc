== Concourse Pipeline (Kubernetes)

IMPORTANT: In this chapter we assume that you perform deployment of your application
to Kubernetes PaaS

[[concourse]] The Spring Cloud Pipelines repository contains opinionated
Concourse pipeline definition. Those jobs will form an empty pipeline and a
sample, opinionated one that you can use in your company.

All in all there are the following projects taking part in the whole `microservice setup` for this demo.

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes[Github Analytics] - the app that has a REST endpoint and uses messaging. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook] - project that emits messages that are used by Github Analytics. Our business application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Eureka] - simple Eureka Server. This is an infrastructure application.
- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot[Github Analytics Stub Runner Boot] - Stub Runner Boot server to be used for tests with Github Analytics. Uses Eureka and Messaging. This is an infrastructure application.

[[step-by-step-k8s]]
=== Step by step

This is a guide for Concourse pipeline.

If you want to just run the demo as far as possible using PCF Dev and Docker Compose

- <<concourse-fork-k8s,Fork repos>>
- <<concourse-start-k8s,Start Concourse and Artifactory>>
- <<concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s,Setup the `fly` CLI >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s,Setup your `credentials.yml` >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-build-k8s,Setup the pipeline >>
- <<concourse-pipeline-run-k8s,Run the `github-webhook` pipeline>>

[[fork-repos-k8s]]
==== Fork repos

[[concourse-fork-k8s]] There are 4 apps that are composing the pipeline

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-webhook-kubernetes[Github Webhook]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-eureka[Github Eureka]
  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-stub-runner-boot-classpath-stubs[Github Stub Runner Boot]

You need to fork only these. That's because only then will your user be able to tag and push the tag to repo.

  - https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/github-analytics-kubernetes/[Github Analytics]

[[concourse-start-k8s]]
=== Concourse in K8S (Kubernetes)

The simplest way to deploy Concourse to K8S is to use https://github.com/kubernetes/helm[Helm].
Once you have Helm installed and your `kubectl` is pointing to the
cluster, just type this command to install the Concourse cluster in your K8S cluster.

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install stable/concourse --name concourse
----

Once it's done you'll see the following output

[source,bash]
----
1. Concourse can be accessed:

  * Within your cluster, at the following DNS name at port 8080:

    concourse-web.default.svc.cluster.local

  * From outside the cluster, run these commands in the same shell:

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080

2. Login with the following credentials

  Username: concourse
  Password: concourse
----

Just follow these steps and log in to Concourse under http://127.0.0.1:8080.

==== Deploying Artifactory to K8S

We can use Helm also to deploy Artifactory to K8S

[source,bash]
----
$ helm install --name artifactory --set artifactory.image.repository=docker.bintray.io/jfrog/artifactory-oss stable/artifactory
----

After executing this you'll see the following output

[source,bash]
----
NOTES:
Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory Pro!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc -w nginx'
   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default nginx -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

2. Open Artifactory in your browser
   Default credential for Artifactory:
   user: admin
   password: password
----

Next, we need to set up the repositories.

First, access the Artifactory URL and log in with
user, `admin` and `password` password.

image::{concourse-root-docs}/artifactory_quick_setup.png[title="Click on the `Quick Setup`"]

Then, click on the Maven setup and click `Create`.

[[concourse-pipeline-fly-k8s]]
==== Setup the `fly` CLI

[[fly]] If you go to Concourse website you should see sth like this:

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

image::{concourse-root-docs}/running_concourse.png[]

{nbsp}
{nbsp}

You can click one of the icons (depending on your OS) to download `fly`, which is the Concourse CLI. Once you've downloaded that (and maybe added to your PATH) you can run:

[source,bash]
----
fly --version
----

If `fly` is properly installed then it should print out the version.

[[concourse-pipeline-credentials-k8s]]
==== Setup your `credentials.yml`

There is a sample credentials file called `credentials-sample-k8s.yml`
prepared for `k8s`. You can use it as a base for your `credentials.yml`.

To allow the Concourse worker's spawned container to connect to
Kubernetes cluster you will need to pass the CA contents and the
auth token.

To get the contents of CA for GCE just execute

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode
----

To get the token just type:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get secret $(kubectl get secret | grep default-token | awk '{print $1}') -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
----

Set that value under `paas-test-client-token`, `paas-stage-client-token` and `paas-prod-client-token`

[[concourse-pipeline-build-k8s]]
==== Build the pipeline

After running Concourse you should get the following output in your terminal

[source,bash]
----
$ export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=concourse-web" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
$ echo "Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse"
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:8080
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to use Concourse
----

Log in (e.g. for Concourse running at `127.0.0.1` - if you don't provide any value then `localhost` is assumed). If you execute this script  (it assumes that either `fly` is on your `PATH` or it's in the same folder as the script is):

[source,bash]
----
$ fly -t k8s login -c http://localhost:8080 -u concourse -p concourse
----

Next run the command to create the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./set_pipeline.sh github-webhook k8s credentials-k8s.yml
----

[[concourse-pipeline-run-k8s]]
